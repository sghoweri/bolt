### Bug Fixes

* add a custom event to the nav-priority component to let others know when the component is ready to go (like the nav-indicator); update nav indicator logic to listen for this even before trying to animate if the nav-priority is a nested component AND isn't yet ready to go ([275b9f1](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/275b9f1))

* fixing nav-indicator logic so multiple navbars on a page track behavior consistently ([bb26c57](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/bb26c57))
* make sure nav AND nav.nav are both not undefined before trying to animate ([0b8a50a](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/0b8a50a))
* move the gumshoe.js dependency to the correct package using it ([9ff489e](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/9ff489e))
* re-enable <bolt-nav-indicator> workaround to prevent animating the line in to the wrong location as soon as the page loads ([b9577e3](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/b9577e3))
* update nav-indicator connecting Promise order so indicator animates in a bit more consistently ([f755d07](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/f755d07))
* update navlink to address indicator positioning in IE 11 ([03a4933](https://github.com/bolt-design-system/bolt/tree/master/packages/components/bolt-navbar/commit/03a4933))
