> Note: This package will be removed in Bolt `v3.0` when we drop IE11 support, modern browsers support async CSS loading natively. See [migrating to Bolt `v3.x`](http://boltdesignsystem.com/docs/guides/migrating-to-3.x.html) docs for more info.

Adds automatic `<link rel="preload">` async CSS Loading support for browsers that don't natively support it (via the Filamentgroup's invaluable [loadCSS])(https://www.npmjs.com/package/fg-loadcss) library).
